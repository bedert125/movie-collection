# movie collection

You can start your collection!!!, this is a base-repo to create any type of collection. The first approach is a movie collection however you can change the data APIs and the catalog types as well (they need some improvements).

To change 
APIs https://github.com/bedert125/movie_collection/blob/main/lib/config_view.dart 
    to save in the user data: https://github.com/bedert125/movie_collection/blob/main/lib/conf/config.dart
    
 
Catalog: https://github.com/bedert125/movie_collection/blob/main/lib/collection_database.dart
